# armyGame
## api endpoints
/army
/conscript
/levelup
/choose_opponent
/fight
/login
/create_account
/rage_quit
 What I want in the game:

 -To have a user be able to log in and retrieve the information for their army (which persists)
 
 -An interactive screen where a user can grow the army
 
 -An interactive page where a user can choose an opponent
 
 -A time based (probably...) system for awarding modification points.

## Other items:
 -A way to limit how many times one person can be fought (so they don't log in and have no army anymore...)
 
 -A way to match users with opponents of somewhat comparable levels.
 Level up mechanism and limits

 # Implement on a Grid

 - Create a map
 - Create avatars that can be attached to soldier objects and moved upon a map
 - Units need a movement range
 - Units need an attack range
 - Fight mechanics would have to be reworked entirely to make individual battles between units not all or nothing.
